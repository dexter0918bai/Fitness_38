We could not find a way to access usda database because less material and they change a lot after 2019, so we write a json file to keep more than 70 food with their carb, fat, protein, unit. FoodList feature can allow user search, add food and pass the detail of food to FoodSummary feature.

FoodSummary is a pie chart to show the percentage and gram of carb , fat and protein. It will give user a clear chart to let them know how many nutrient they eat per day.

All the food information has been store in local by using mkmv frame.
